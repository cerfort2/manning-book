    If you have not cloned the repository, you must do so by running the command:
        git clone https://github.com/cerfort2/manning-book

    Open the repository by clicking file> workstation> terraform> manning_book

    Make sure you are working in the correct directory by running the command: cd 

    Run the following commands: 

   snap install aws-cli --classic
   
   aws configure
   You will need to copy your access_key and secret_access_key from the "Cloud Accounts" tab where the command line prompts you to.
   Use "us-east-1" for region
   Press the enter key if the CLI prompts you for an output format

    Run the following commands and your aws vpc will be created: 
    aws ec2 create-default-vpc
    terraform init
    
    terraform apply
    Enter "us-east-1" if prompted for a region
    
    
    terraform destroy (this command destroys all of your resources, and you need to run this in order to complete the other labs)
